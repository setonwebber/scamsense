# scamsense
In alignment with our project goal and background, we intend to produce a mobile application hosting a playable, scenario-based game that incorporates principles of cyber security to enhance user engagement, enjoyment and learning. The app will specialize in the domain of email and mobile scams, whereby the player must correctly differentiate between malicious and benign instances. They will then receive feedback on their answers by highlighting the sections within the email or text message that make it malicious or benign. Players will then continue to the next level, but if at any point they wish to return to a previous level, this option will be provided to them.


### For a successful development of ScamSense to occur, the following list of requirements will need to be met.
- The application will display accurate information regarding cyber security
- The application will highlight issues with scam emails and texts
- The application will accurately respond to user input
- The application will teach the user to recognize scams
- The application will increase with difficulty as the user answers correctly
- The application will decrease with difficulty as the user answers incorrectly
