This is a hitman scam! The scammer will attempt to get a one-time payment from the victim.
The scammer will masquerade as a hitman, alleging that a bounty has been placed on you and the only way out is a fee.
Generally, the scammer will ask to converse elsewhere when delivered via text and will also threaten life if the situation is disclosed.
Remain calm! The threat of life is engineered to produce irrational responses â€“ take a moment to breath.
