isScam = true
This is a prize winnings scam! These types of scams can be quite broad in their target, from malware injection to personal information theft – so be careful.
The scammer will have you believe that you are the winner of an in-house prize competition or the ‘Lotto’.
They will generally point the victim to a link, or request an upfront payment to move the prize winnings.
Stop and think – is this something you entered in the first place?

Scam Indicators:
1.	Mismatched Name
2.	Unusual wording
3.	Suspicious Link
