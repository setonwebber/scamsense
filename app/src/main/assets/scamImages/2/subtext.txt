These scams manipulate the increased use of online shopping and delivery services to gain credit card details.
The scammer will pose as AusPost - particularly cunning as the contact ID will say so. They will allege that your delivery has been suspended or halted due to insufficient details.
A link will be provided that guides the user to a spoofed AusPost website to gain information and/or payment.
Be vigilant and ask if you have a package on the way â€“ if so, investigate independently.
