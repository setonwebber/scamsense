isScam = true
This is a Nigerian Prince “419” scam! These types of scams typically attempt to gain a money payment from the victim.
The scammer will have you believe that they have vast wealth that is ‘frozen’ due to political persecution, government restrictions or tax codes.
They will ask that you supply a fee to ‘unfreeze’ the money, for which you will be rewarded with a large portion of the original wealth and massive returns on investment.
Be cautious with this scam, as you will not receive the funds promised!
