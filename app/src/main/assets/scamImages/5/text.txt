isScam = true
This is a reclaim scam. These types of scams typically attempt to gain a money payment from the victim.
The scammer will masquerade as a prominent agency such as the FBI, CIA or Interpol to trick the victim into a sense of legitimacy or fear of consequence.
Generally, the scammer will make some claim that money is owed for a service, or to avoid a penalty.
Remain calm and remember these agencies will not contact you for payments!
