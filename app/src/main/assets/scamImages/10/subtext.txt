This is an inheritance scam! These types of scams attempt to trick you into divulging money, credit card details or personal ID.
The scammer will have you believe you are the benefactor of a distant relative or recently deceased â€“ typically they will pose as a lawyer, bank or senior official.
The scammer will also claim the scores of money are difficult to obtain, which is why either a fee is needed, bank details, or verification through personal ID.
Be vigilant, and if sounds too good to be true, its likely because it is!
